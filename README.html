        <h3>Programming Experience</h3>
        <p>
            I worked as a data analyst contracted through a marketing agency where I would write surveys, clean results, and analyze data to create charts and graphs to help companies understand trends, user knowledge, and brand awareness. The programs we used were DisplayR, Sawtooth software, SurveyMonkey, Tableau, and a couple others that I can't recall.

            I also did two internships at Huntington Bank where I worked in their data engineering department and MLOps department. I used metadata to perform file ingestions based on customer need. I also wrote a lambda for AWS that would pull files off SharePoint on a Mon-Fri schedule, which would then trigger a series of lambdas to ingest files into the datalake to be used in Snowflake, Athena, and Tableau.
