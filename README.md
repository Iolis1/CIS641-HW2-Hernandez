## Interests
### Personal Interests

* Gaming - I stream whichever game I decide to play pretty regularly on twitch.
* Baking - I love making cakes, cupcakes, cookies, flan, and Cheesecakes.
* Cooking - I pick a region and cook only food from that region every couple months. I have done Asia, Italy, and Mexico. It's a fun little excersize in expanding my cooking ability.

### Technical and Research Interests
* I want to learn more about LLMs and how to utilize them to simplify data for easier public understanding.
* My current research is simplifying medical testing data for patient understanding.

## Technical Background
### Programming Languages
Java, Lisp, Javascript, C, C++, Go, Ruby, Python, Terraform, and assembly language (not very good)

### Programming Experience
I worked as a data analyst contracted through a marketing agency where I would write surveys, clean results, and analyze data to create charts and graphs to help companies understand trends, user knowledge, and brand awareness. The programs we used were DisplayR, Sawtooth software, Survey Monkey, Tableau and a couple others that I can't recall.

I also did two internships at Huntington Bank where I worked in their data engineering department and MLOps department.  I used metadata to perform file ingestions based on customer need.  I also wrote a lambda for AWS that would pull files off sharepoint on a Mon-Fri schedule, which would then trigger a series of lambdas to ingest files into the datalake to be used in snowflake, Athena and Tableau.
